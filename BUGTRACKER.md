## Bugs

- Map is clipped if viewport is thinner than Map
- events are fucked
- can't select or interact
- nothing happens on hover
- try moving tile generation logic around - maybe can be faster
- loading icon is weird svg and not in the center

## Feature Requests

- show passwords when entering
- minimap when zoomed in on the bottom right (rectangle inside rectangle - view inside map)
- help popup
- drawing tools
- note tools
- default tiles to opaque for DM. Add second default - border only. Add third option - opacity (with note on not being performant)
